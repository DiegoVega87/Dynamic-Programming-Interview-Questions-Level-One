    * As a new fitness tracking startup, we want to create a feature that counts the number of distinct ways
    * our users can climb a ladder.  The ladder has n rungs and our users can climb either 1, 2 or 3 steps at a time.
    * We need you to create a function that takes in the number of rungs and returns the number of distinct patterns
    * our users can climb the ladder. This will enable us to track the progress of our users  and provide them with
    * personalized fitness plans.
